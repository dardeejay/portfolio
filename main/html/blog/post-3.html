          <h1>Spider-man!!!!!</h1>
          <p>The newest Spiderman movie, Spiderman: No Way Home, has captured my attention due to its hefty plot and star-studded cast – at least, from what is now known from a movie leak that revealed some of the plot. Passionate fans of the Marvel enterprise were stunned to hear about the news of Peter Parker or Spiderman being more than one character as other characters from different origins of the hero Spiderman were apparently brought back for one eventful reunion, as seen from a prior, animated Spiderman movie, called Into the Spiderverse. It has been suspected – some have already been confirmed – that past villains will also be brought back as multiple versions of Spiderman have come together to fight against them all. I am thrilled to find out more and watch the full movie unfold when it comes out this January.
