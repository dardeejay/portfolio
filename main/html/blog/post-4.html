          <h1>My Passion for Programming</h1>
          <p>I discovered my passion for computer programming way back when I was still in 8th grade where my high school at that time held a Science Fair with an NGO organization in robotics who went into each classroom including ours. They created an event where students in one class were grouped into four and were taught how to build robots. In our group, I quickly learned the programming mechanics and was the sole programmer among my groupmates. We eventually got awarded with a prize for Best Programming, amongst all other programs.
            Then, during grades 9 and 10, I studied programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was doing coding in my personal computer until such time that it unfortunately broke down.
            Afterwards, when I became a senior high school student, my interest in programming came back to me and I was inspired to learn Python and Java, using only a coding app that can be downloaded on my mobile phone.
            Eventually I became a college student and enrolled in Comteq Computer and Business College under the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. The experience was a unique one for me and I was highly motivated to study my chosen course. Despite not having a personal computer and needing to use internet cafes to accomplish my activities, I was still one of the best achievers in my class with a flat uno grade in the subjects Computer Programming I and Data Structures and Algorithm.
            I was even supposed to be trained in the skills competition for software development in my college, but unfortunately, I couldn’t continue what I’ve started due to financial issues. 
            As Comteq is a private institution, I couldn’t redeem my grades without payment, and was pushed back 2 years in my education. 
            Now, being back in college as a first-year ACT student in Gordon College, I am doing my best to get back on track with my education, resume my progress, and rekindle my long-lost passion for computer programming.</p>
