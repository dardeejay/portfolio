          <h1>My First Impression</h1>
          <p>My personal experience with the course subject, PC Troubleshooting was not very pleasant. While it is true that the subject requires basic computer literacy such as being aware of the hardware and software parts of a computer, understanding how it operates, and having the skills to analyze and solve its problems, it doesnâ€™t mean that the course should be taught in an overly simplified way where rote memorization is prioritized over any real learning. The way PC Troubleshooting is being taught to us now is redundant and often times the content of our lessons is unnecessary to truly understand how to avoid problems and fix computer issues. In my opinion, the best way to understand what we are studying is to learn by doing or to troubleshoot real problems found in an actual non-working computer.
